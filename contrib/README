== thtkpp (c++ binding) ==

== uthdat (midnight commander extfs plugin) ==
Supports list and copyout commands.

If your midnight commander is installed without local prefix, while thtk is 
installed with one (or vice versa), you need to symlink uthdat like so:
# ln -s /usr/local/lib/mc/extfs.d/uthdat /usr/lib/mc/extfs.d/uthdat
Alternatively you might link it localy for your user like so
$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/mc/extfs.d/uthdat ~/.local/share/mc/extfs.d/uthdat

For your ext file:
regex/\.(伝|録|郷|“\`|\˜\^|‹½|DAT|dat)$
	Open=%cd %p/uthdat://

== wcthdat (total commander wcx plugin) ==
Read-only. Supports Unicode plugin interface.

Make sure you have thtk.dll in the same directory as wcthdat.dll

Rename DLL to wcthdat.wcx (or .wcx64 if you're brave enough to compile 64-bit
version)
In total commander go to
 Configuration -> Options -> Plugins -> Packer plugins (.WCX) -> Configure
You will be presented with the most counterintuitive UI for plugin selection.
I usually just click all over it until it works.

Alternatively you may add this to your wincmd.ini:

[PackerPlugins]
dat=64,C:\Users\ZUN\tannedcirno\thtk\build\contrib\RelWithDebInfo\wcthdat.dll

64 means that this plugin supports detection by content. Usually totalcmd gets
this number from GetPackerCaps function. If you want to disable that, change it
to 0.
